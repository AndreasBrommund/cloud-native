# Chapter 11. Billing and cleanup

By now you've created a lot of resources in AWS, and even though AWS is relatively inexpensive, it will cost money. On top of that the resources have been created in your personal account.

1. To find out what AWS will charge us for the services you've created, open the AWS service menu and select Billing.
1. Here you can see the balance for previous months, the balance for the current month up until today and finally a forecast for the current month.
1. The next step is to clean up after the course and avoid any unnecessary charges.
1. Go to CloudFormation from the service menu and look at the different stacks that you've created for the course.
1. When you delete a stack, all resources that the stack in question created will be deleted from your AWS account.
1. Mark a stack and click delete to delete it.
